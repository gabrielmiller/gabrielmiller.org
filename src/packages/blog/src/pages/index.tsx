                <p>üëã Hi there! My name is Gabe. Thanks for visiting my website.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in most things web-development, databases, security, and GIS. I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.digitalonboarding.com/">Digital Onboarding</a>. I previously have worked at <a href="https://heggerty.org/">Heggerty</a> and <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com">JazzHR</a>, formerly known as <em>Jazz</em> and before that as <em>The Resumator</em>. I have over 12 years of full-stack web development experience, more recently focused on front-end development, architecture, distributed systems, and data.</p>
                <p>Growing up I played PC games and as a result was exposed to computers at a young and formative age. Despite that I was a late entrant to the software industry. I am a self-taught engineer and earned a degree in environmental studies and a certificate in geographic information systems.</p>
                <p>I am a proponent of open-source software and appreciate its many communities.</p>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy:</p>

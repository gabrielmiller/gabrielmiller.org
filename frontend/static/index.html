        <p>Hi there! My name is Gabe.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in most things web-development, databases, security, and GIS. I work on the software engineering team at <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com">JazzHR</a>, which was formerly known as <em>Jazz</em> and before that <em>The Resumator</em>.</p> I grew up playing PC games and was exposed to building computers at a young age. I was a late entrant to the software industry; I'm a self-taught engineer and actually did not study computer science in college.</p>
        <p>I am a proponent of open-source software and appreciate its many communities.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy tinkering with personal software projects, which as of late has been moving my data and usage of cloud services to self-hosted alternatives on in-house hardware. I am a dedicated recreational athlete; I regularly run, row, and boulder. I am a hobbyist woodworker--more on the ornate side of the spectrum--utilizing both hand and power tools. I also enjoy gardening.</p>
        <p>I intend to publish some of my software-related thought--and maybe some other miscellaneous stuff--on this website.</p>
        <p>This blog is comprised of personal thoughts, work, and projects unless otherwise noted. None of the opinions expressed within represent those of my employer.</p>
        <p>You can find my current resume <a href="resume.pdf">here</a> which has my contact information in it. Additionally, you can view my github account <a href="https://github.com/gabrielmiller/">here</a>.</p>

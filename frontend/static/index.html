            <p>Hi there! My name is Gabe.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in most things web-development, databases, security, and GIS. I work on the software engineering team at <a href="https://www.jazzhr.com">JazzHR</a>, which was formerly known as <em>Jazz</em> and before that <em>The Resumator</em>. I'm a full-stack engineer and gravitate toward front-end development, testing, and data.</p>
            <p>Growing up I played PC games and as a result was exposed to building computers at a young age. Despite that I was a late entrant to the software industry. I'm a self-taught software engineer and hold a degree in environmental studies.</p>
            <p>I am a proponent of open-source software and appreciate its many communities.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy tinkering with personal software projects, which as of late has been moving my data and usage of cloud services to self-hosted alternatives on in-house hardware. I am a dedicated recreational athlete; I regularly run, row, and boulder. I am a hobbyist woodworker--closer to the ornate end of the spectrum--utilizing both hand and power tools. I also enjoy gardening.</p>
            <p>I intend to publish some of my software-related thoughts--and maybe some other miscellaneous stuff--on this website.</p>
            <p>This website is comprised of personal thoughts, work, and projects unless otherwise noted. None of the opinions expressed within represent those of my employer.</p>
            <p>You can find my current resume <a href="lgabrielmiller.pdf">here</a>.

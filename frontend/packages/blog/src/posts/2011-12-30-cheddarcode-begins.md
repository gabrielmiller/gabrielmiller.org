Hi guys!

Here's to a new website and some new adventures. I've been learning Python and a couple programs and frameworks along the way--django, git, vim, and perhaps some more in the future. You'll find posts about things I enjoy, am having trouble with, or otherwise felt like sharing. Hopefully it will all be riveting. I also plan to use this blog as a learning experience; I will be posting original work and then revisiting it to revise and find my old mistakes.

Cheers!

It's been a while, hasn't it? I haven't written a blog post in 9 years, and I couldn't even tell you when my old website went defunct.

Well, I've decided to start fresh with another blog! For the past several years I've dramatically cut down on my usage of social media because I fell into unhealthy usage habits and it didn't feel like I was getting value out of it. So consider this blog the start of a personal adventure into what I wish to broadcast.

On that note, I'm not entirely if I'll limit myself to purely technical content like I did in previous blogging efforts; I'm still figuring that out. I've kickstarted this thing with a handful of entries from my old blog, which generally are about learning technical concepts.

Stay healthy out there.
